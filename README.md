I'm Elis from Tanzania, 22' Web developer and Data engineer.I am currently pursuing a degree in computer engineering, and I have 3 years of experience in professional software development. 

I am proficient in building APIs,Databases, and all kinds of web applications. I believe in a world where **everything is possible**, and I am driven to create innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what is achievable.

Originally from Tanzania, I am available for *full-time*, *part-time*, or *freelance collaborations*. I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences with others, which is why I create learning content for web and data development on YouTube and Instagram. Additionally, I maintain a Telegram channel where I share valuable learning resources. I enjoy every moment I spend working on the web, as I have a deep understanding of how it functions.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repository to see examples of my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
